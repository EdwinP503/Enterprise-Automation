# Enterprise-Automation

Project Overview: This project was completed during my internship at Rapid7 as part of the Automations & Productivity team. The objective was to streamline and automate the account provisioning and deprovisioning processes across multiple departments and locations, replacing previously manual processes with secure, automated workflows.

Objective: To automate user account lifecycle management (provisioning and deprovisioning) to reduce manual effort, minimize human error, and improve operational efficiency across the organization.

Technologies Used:

Okta Workflows: Managed identity and access workflows for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning.
Workato: Integrated various applications, facilitating seamless data flows across multiple departments.
Python: For data analysis to assess automation performance and operational impact.
Implementation Details:

Automation Design:

Built workflows in Okta Workflows to automate onboarding and offboarding processes, allowing for consistent, error-free user account management.
Used Workato to integrate internal applications, ensuring data accuracy and secure synchronization of employee data between systems.
Documentation and Training:

Created detailed documentation for each workflow, including reusable guides and training materials.
Provided training sessions for IT staff, enabling them to manage and extend automation solutions.
Results:

Reduced manual effort for account management across departments.
Achieved a measurable reduction in operational errors related to manual account provisioning.
Empowered IT teams with resources to maintain and expand the automated workflows independently.
